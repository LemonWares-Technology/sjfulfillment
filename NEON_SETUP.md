# Neon PostgreSQL Setup Guide

## 🐘 Setting up Neon Database for SJFulfillment

### Step 1: Create Neon Account
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project

### Step 2: Get Database Connection String
1. In your Neon dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Connection Details"
3. Copy the connection string (it looks like this):
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Add this to your Vercel environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations
After deployment, run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 5: Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## 🔧 Neon Configuration

### Connection Pooling
Neon automatically handles connection pooling, so you don't need to configure it separately.

### SSL
Neon requires SSL connections, which is automatically handled by the connection string.

### Backup
Neon provides automatic backups and point-in-time recovery.
